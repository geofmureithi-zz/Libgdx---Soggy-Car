====================
![soggycar](http://i.imgur.com/g60kQa0.jpg)

Soggy Car is a vertical-scrolling game with score keeping and ownership of different cars.

### You may try it here:
  * [Android / Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.traffic.spilot)
  * Desktop - find the soggycar.jar in desktop/build folder.

### Note:
  * I've released this game as open source to contribute to the libgdx community. I hope it may act as an inspiration code to help you deal with applying logic code such as character selection.
  * I ask that you don't blatantly copy-paste but rather actually do learn from this in creating your own libgdx app.
  * The music that was used in the game was done by DOS-88 and you may find him on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/dos-88).
